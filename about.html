				<h3>About Us</h3>
				<p>Crystalized Mind was officially launched in 2019 as an events company, but attendees wanted to take what they learned home with them.A small team decided to make these techniques available online so more people could experience the benefits of meditation anytime, anywhere. And that blossomed into the Crystalized Mind you see today: guided meditations, animations, articles and videos, all in the distinct Crystalized Mind style.<br>	
				You can try Crystalized Mind for yourself and learn the essentials of meditation and mindfulness with our free Basics course. If you enjoy it, then it’s time to subscribe. Once you do, you’ll have bite-sized minis for when you’re short on time, exercises to add extra mindfulness to your day, and hundreds of meditations on everything from stress to sleep.</p>

				<h3>What We Do</h3>
				<p>At Crystalized Mind we see meditation as both a practice rooted in ancient history and a topic of modern science. This is why we are as equally committed to providing authentic expertise in meditation and also studying the science of meditation.<br><br>
				Science has been an integral part of the Headspace business since day one. We recognize that the only way to know if we are achieving our goal of improving the health and happiness of the world is to measure it.</p>
