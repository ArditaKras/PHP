  						<p>Meditation is both a skill and an experience - a formal exercise to cultivate awareness and compassion. By sitting with the mind, we're training it to be more open and at ease, and we consequently discover greater calm, clarity, contentment, and compassion. In doing so, we increasingly learn to have a direct experience of the present moment.</p>
						<strong>Some of this may seem abstract; it can also be helpful to describe what meditation is not:</strong>
							<ol class="pika">
								<li>Meditation is not about “emptying the mind,” “clearing the mind,” or “stopping thoughts.” The mind’s nature is to think. We meditate to see those thoughts more clearly.<br></li>
								<li>Meditation is not about becoming a different person, a new person, or a better person.<br></li>
								<li>Meditation is not the same as concentration. It is not the active engagement of the mind on a specific topic.<br></li>
								<li>Meditation does not guarantee relaxation, serenity, or bliss. Relaxation can certainly be a side effect of it, but meditation involves a range of feelings, not simply the nicer ones.<br></li>
								<li>Meditation is not “checking out” or escaping our problems or duties.<br></li>
								<li>Meditation is not necessarily spiritual or religious. It shares a very long history with religion and offers an important spiritual component for many practitioners. But anyone can meditate, regardless of creed.</li></ol></p>

					<button class="button button1">Top 13 Meditation Tips</button>
						<div class="panel">
  							<p>If you’re new to meditation and finding it challenging to maintain a regular practice, we wanted to take a moment to point out that it’s completely normal for beginners to experience some discomfort or frustration when starting out — after all, you’re learning a brand new skill! </br>
						The mind will often resist being tamed by kicking up all sorts of excuses — restlessness, boredom, and doubt, among them. Sitting with the mind requires commitment, discipline, and perseverance if you are to experience the benefits of meditation — there is no quick fix!</br>
						The following meditation tips will help you work through the common obstacles that many beginners encounter, so you can establish a strong foundation for your practice and, more importantly, stick with it.</p>
						<h3>5 tips for BEFORE your meditation</h3>
							<p>1. Start early.<br/> Try to meditate first thing in the morning. That way you can be sure that it actually gets done and not bumped off the to-do list as the day gets more hectic. Plus, morning meditation can be a nice way to start the day — you’re refreshed, awake, and on track for a mindful day.</p>
							<p>2. Same time, same place.<br/> If you can’t meditate in the morning, try to make a commitment to meditating at the same time and in the same place every day. Making your practice a regular part of your normal daily routine is key to developing a lasting habit.</p>
							<p>3. Get creative about location.<br/> Yes, it’s recommended that your regular meditation practice happens in the same place every day for consistency. But sometimes that simply isn’t possible. The great thing about meditation is that it can be practiced anywhere — at home, at work, in a park, even walking in a busy airport. It doesn’t matter where it happens, as long as you can find stillness and not be disturbed.</p>
							<p>4. Don’t sit cross-legged (if you don’t think it’s comfortable).<br/> Forget the stereotypical images of people sitting cross-legged to meditate; for most people, that position can be uncomfortable — and distracting. What’s most important is to find the meditation position that’s most comfortable for you (and if that just so happens to be sitting cross-legged, then of course that’s perfectly fine).</p>
							<p>5. Find the best position for you. <br/>There are four meditation positions that we find work most optimally. You don’t need to force yourself to sit up too straight. If you’re too upright, your mind will be too uptight. The ideal meditating position for most people is somewhere in between: sitting in a chair or on a sofa or couch, arms and legs uncrossed, feet flat on the floor, a cushion or rolled up towel underneath the 	backside, so that the back is naturally upright.</p>
						<h3>3 tips for DURING meditation</h3>
							<p>1. Breathe naturally.<br/> Meditation does involve focusing on the breath and using it as an anchor for the mind, but try not to think about the breath or alter it in any way. Simply allow things to unfold naturally, noticing the rising and falling sensation it creates in the body.</p>
							<p>2. Get comfortable with discomfort. <br/> People who are new to meditation — and even people who have been doing it for years — often experience negative emotions like anxiety, restlessness, and irritation while practicing. Rather than trying to resist these emotions, give them your full attention and allow them to come and go. Over time the mind learns to recognize these emotions but gets used to not getting caught up in negative patterns of thought — a skill that can be enormously beneficial not only during meditation but also in daily life.</p>
							<p>3. Take mindfulness with you.<br/> Before you finish meditating and go about your day, form a clear idea of what you are going to do next — maybe you’ll shower, or make breakfast, or drive the kids to school. Whatever the activity, try to carry the mindfulness you cultivated during your meditation with you into the next task and throughout the rest of your day.</p>
						<h3>5 tips for AFTER meditation</h3>
							<p>1. <strong><em>Take a moment and check in with yourself.</em></strong><br/> After each session, try to take a moment to notice how you feel physically, emotionally, and mentally. Are you more calm than you were when you sat down? Does your mind feel more clear? Are you more focused on the day ahead? The more you’re able to establish a connection between your meditation practice and feeling better, the more invested you’ll be in finding time to sit down each day for practice.</p>
							<p>2. Remind yourself of the benefits of meditation.</p>
							<p>3. Record any excuses. <br/> If you decide not to meditate one day, make a note of your reasoning. Seeing the excuse written down can help to minimize it. Tomorrow it won’t have the same power over you, especially when compared to how important the health of your mind really is.</p>
							<p>4. Buddy up. <br/>Try to get a friend to start meditating, too. You don’t have to meditate at the same time, but having someone who’s also looking to meditating regularly can help motivate you toward establishing a consistent practice. With a friend as an accountability partner, you’re less likely to make excuses and more likely to show up day after day.</p>
							<p>5. Don’t judge.<br/> Don’t judge. It may be tempting to judge each meditation practice as “good” or “bad” and, once you’ve been doing it for a while, to wonder if you are “improving.” Try to resist this urge to analyze your progress in terms of whether you experience lightning bolts of insights or dramatic life shifts. Instead, the next time you meditate, take a minute at the end to notice if you feel any different from when you sat down — perhaps you’re a little less tense or a little more aware of how you feel. Mediation isn’t something we ever expect to master or excel at; rather, it’s a life-long skill we are constantly working on day by day.</p>

					<button class="button button1">The Benefits of Daily Meditation</button>
						<div class="panel">
  							<p>Daily meditation — the practice of staying present and mindful for a limited period of time — can have numerous benefits for our mental and physical health. Yet, many of us don’t meditate every day because we’re too busy or we simply don’t feel like it. Sound familiar?
						The thing about meditation though is that we experience even greater benefits when we repeat the practice frequently and consistently. Finding some time each day to meditate — even a short daily meditation — is better than no meditation at all. Here’s information and actionable tips to help you make meditation a part of your regular routine.</p>
						<h4>What are the positive effects seen with daily meditation?</h4>
							<p>Science has proven that the benefits of meditation are too good to ignore. And while we don’t need to meditate daily to experience its positive effect on your health and happiness, studies have shown that we can unlock even more benefits when we meditate for consecutive days. In fact, completing just one 15-minute session of meditation using the Headspace app resulted in 22% reduction in mind wandering. And four weeks of using Headspace daily resulted in 14% increase in focus.</p>

							<p>When we meditate, we can enhance our focus and decision-making and lessen our feelings of fear and stress. The result: by fundamentally shifting the way we relate to our thoughts and feelings, we can dial down the intensity of emotions that tend to take hold of us, and ultimately experience a greater sense of calm, clarity, and focus in our lives.</p>

							<p>The particular benefits of daily generalized meditation are well-documented and widespread, ranging from reduction in anxiousness and lower blood pressure to increased immunity and better sleep. In a study that did not use the Headspace app, researchers from John Hopkins University found general mindfulness meditation programs helped ease psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety, and pain related to stress. According to another study using a generalized form of meditation, people who meditate have lower levels of cortisol, a hormone associated with physical and emotional stress. Generalized meditation has also been shown to improve sleep quality and, for those with chronic pain, increase pain tolerance.</p>

							<p>What’s more, people who meditate have also reported improvements in their relationships, likely because meditation stimulates the part of the brain associated with empathy. Three weeks of using the Headspace app was found to increase compassion in study participants by 23%.</p>

							<p>In short, there are so many scientifically-backed ways meditation can help your mind and body.</p>
